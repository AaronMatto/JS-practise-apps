This is a basic memory game and the final app I made myself before enrolling on a coding bootcamp. It requires the user to flip a card and then flip another; if
they match then the cards stay flipped. The goal is to flip all cards in as few clicks as possible (of course, there is a significant element of luck to this).

This was an exciting app to make as it naturally involved coming up with a basic shuffle algorithm for the cards and constructing a way for the computer to 
recognise if two cards flipped consecutively were the same. The goal was not to have a great design here as by now I felt much more confident with CSS; the main
aim was to tackle more challenging JS.

The app does work however there are some obvious improvments. Making the first card stay flipped over and then the second card switching back to unflipped if 
incorrect would without doubt make a better UX. Also adding animations for the flipping and improving the overall design of the app.
