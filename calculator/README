This is the very first app I made. It took some time as I didn't want to solve any problems by resorting to an online tutorial
- I had learned the relevant material it just needed to be applied correctly. 
I enjoyed this a lot and began to think about the quality of code in the program (even if insignificant) hence the use of the switch statement 
instead of multiple ifs. I also tried to employ best efficiency practises by using event bubbling on the container for the buttons as opposed to
attaching an event listener for each button.
